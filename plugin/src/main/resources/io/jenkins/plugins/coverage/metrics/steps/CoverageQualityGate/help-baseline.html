    Select the baseline to be used for the code coverage computation of this quality gate.

    The following different baselines are supported:

    <dl>
        <dt>Overall project - PROJECT</dt>
        <dd>
            Coverage of the whole project. This is an absolute value that might not change much from build to build.
        </dd>
        <dt>Overall project (difference to reference job) - PROJECT_DELTA</dt>
        <dd>
            Difference between the project coverages of the current build and the reference build. Teams can use this delta
            value to ensure that the overall project coverage will not decrease.
        </dd>
        <dt>Modified files - MODIFIED_FILES</dt>
        <dd>
            Coverage of the modified files (e.g., within the files that have been touched in a pull or merge request)
            will focus on new or modified files only.
        </dd>
        <dt>Modified files (difference to reference job) - MODIFIED_FILES_DELTA</dt>
        <dd>
            Difference between the file coverages of the current build and the reference build. Teams can use this delta
            value to ensure that the overall coverage of all modified files will not decrease.
            This also implies that the overall project coverage will not decrease, making this metric stricter
            than the PROJECT_DELTA metric
        </dd>
        <dt>Modified code lines - MODIFIED_LINES</dt>
        <dd>
            Coverage of the modified lines (e.g., within the modified lines of a pull or merge request)
            will focus on new or modified code only.
        </dd>
        <dt>Modified code lines (difference to modified files) - MODIFIED_LINES_DELTA</dt>
        <dd>
            Difference between the coverages of the modified lines and the modified files of the current build.
            Teams can use this delta value to ensure that the coverage of pull requests is better than the
            existing coverage of the modified files.
        </dd>
    </dl>
